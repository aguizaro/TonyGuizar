            I am a software developer with a passion for creating games and
            building practical tools. I have experience with Unity, C#, and
            JavaScript for game development. I am currently pursuing a BS in
            Computer Science: Game Design at UC Santa Cruz and will be
            graduating in the summer of 2024. Currently, I am working on a
            multiplayer golf party game for a university course. I am using
            Unity and C# to develop a seamless and enjoyable online experience.

            Beyond game development, I have experience building web
            applications. I have worked with front end tools like React and
            Bootstrap, to create engaging user interfaces. I have also worked
            with back end tools like Node.js, Flask, Express, and MongoDB to
            create web applications. I am always looking for new projects to
            work on and new technologies to learn.
